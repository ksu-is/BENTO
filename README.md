# How It Works

"BENTO" helps the user make a lunchbox according to the needs specified.

This virtual lunchbox has containers waiting to be filled with foods of your choice.

It will ask the user for dietary restrictions before suggesting options.

Foods will be shown in categories, but the intention is not to force a "healthy" or balanced meal.

Ultimately it is up to the user to select what foods fill the predetermined number of boxes.
